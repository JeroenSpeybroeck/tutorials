# The INBO citation style

Most journals, publishers and companies use a specified format for citations and bibliographies.
The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) is no exception.

All bibliography managers provide ways to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies which greatly facilitates scientific publishing.
Depending on the bibliographic manager software, the style formatting rules are stored in specific files.
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the INBO citation style in EndNote, Mendeley and Zotero bibliography managers.

EndNote uses a `*.ens` file to store the style formatting rules, whereas Mendeley and Zotero use the open standard `*.csl` [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/).

The latest official CSL file of the INBO citation style is available at the CSL style repository (also transferred automatically to the Zotero style repository).
See (finding-and-installing-styles)[https://citationstyles.org/authors/#/finding-and-installing-styles] for more information.

Here are direct links to the CSL file:

- (file in the CSL style repository)[https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest.csl]
- (file in the Zotero style repository)[https://www.zotero.org/styles/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest]

The link to the Zotero style repository lets you directly download the style file.

In case older versions are needed, they can be obtained from successively numbered releases from our [forked styles repo](https://github.com/inbo/styles/releases).
To use such a downloaded csl file, you will need to manually add the file to your reference manager.
However note that the version will remain fixed in this case!

The EndNote `*.ens` file can be downloaded (here)[https://sites.google.com/a/inbo.be/intranet/ondersteuning/bibliotheek/endnote-informatie/endnotehuisstijl] (only accessible for INBO employees).

Curious what the formatted INBO citation style and bibliography looks like for various document types?

1. In the search field in the popup window that opens type "Research Institute for Nature and Forest" and click on the corresponding link


There are good online tutorials that explain how to use Zotero in combination with [google docs](https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs), [MS Word](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage) and [LibreOffice](https://www.zotero.org/support/libreoffice_writer_plugin_usage). 

## Mendeley

1. Go to `View > Citation styles > More styles > Get more styles`
1. In the search field type "Research Institute for Nature and Forest" and click "use this style"

Guidelines on how to use Mendeley in combination with MS Word or LibreOffice can be found [here](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/using-citation-editor).

## EndNote

1. (Download the INBO style file)[https://sites.google.com/a/inbo.be/intranet/ondersteuning/bibliotheek/endnote-informatie/endnotehuisstijl]
1. If you do not already have a folder where style files are stored, create one (make sure you have read and write rights and choose a good location that will not be accidentally deleted (not on your desktop)
1. In EndNote go to `Edit > Preferences > Folder Locations > Style Folder` and
choose the folder containing the style file(s)
1. Go to `Edit > Output Styles > Open Style Manager` and activate the INBO style and other styles you want to use (check the box)

    ![](endnote_styles.png)

1. The styles carry a name and version number, so they can be used at will.
1. The INBO style can now be used in Windows Word through the EndNote add-on.
